# network_LIF
C code for a generic balanced network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, with sparse and random connections and synaptic dynamics. Details about the network model can be found in the article ['Dynamics of Sparsely Connected Networks of Excitatory and Inhibitory Spiking Neurons'](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008925309027) by Nicolas Brunel and published in Journal of Computational Neuroscience May 2000, Volume 8, Issue 3, pp 183-208. Unlike the model described in the article, the code incorporates dynamics for the synaptic currents.
